# 2023 September 15th

## Session skipped

I took the night off from my Modern Smurfs Village session on 2023, Friday, September 15th due to being too tired to play. This is the eighth time to date. I will play again on 2023, Saturday, September 16th. This break period is becoming increasingly common, and is justified, as long as I play the next day. This time, I was able to play Motor World Car Factory first, but was too tired to keep on going, and thus skipped my Modern Smurfs Village session.
